# MLE-birth-death-process
An Implementation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters &#654; and &#613; of a simple birth and death process observed continuously over a fixed time interval is studied. Asymptotic distributions for large initial populations and for large periods of observations are derived and some nonstandard results appear.

## Background Information
MLE is used to estimate parameters of a probability distribution to model a given random process.

Given C sets of classes represented by w<sub>j</sub> (0 <= j < C) where each class have a number of samples and a feature vector x.

Representing a class conditional density that fits a gaussian distribution.
### &#420;(x | w<sub>j</sub>) &asymp; &#413;(&#613;<sub>j</sub>, &#425;<sub>k</sub>),
where &#613;<sub>j</sub> is the mean vector value for a given class and &#425;<sub>k</sub> is the standard deviation vector of its k samples.
