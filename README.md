# MLE-birth-death-process
An Implementation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters lambda and myu of a simple birth and death process observed continuously over a fixed time interval is studied. Asymptotic distributions for large initial populations and for large periods of observations are derived and some nonstandard results appear.

## Background Information
MLE is used to estimate parameters of a probability distribution to model a given random process.

Given C sets of classes represented by w<sub>j (0 <= j < C) where each class have a number of samples and a feature vector x.

Representing a class conditional density.
### p(x | w<sub>j)
