# MLE-birth-death-process
An Implementation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters lambda and myu of a simple birth and death process observed continuously over a fixed time interval is studied. Asymptotic distributions for large initial populations and for large periods of observations are derived and some nonstandard results appear.
